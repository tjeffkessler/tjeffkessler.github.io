# DSPortfolio: Data Science Portfolio Projects

This repository was created during my time as a Data Science student at Thinkful to host data science projects and drills that would showcase concepts and skills I learned as I progressed in the field. After some reorganization, I continue to use this repository to store one-off personal projects that don't merit their own repository (like exploratory data analysis in a Jupyter notebook).

## Why this repository?

To display portfolio projects easily by linking this repository to Github pages.

## Languages/Tools Used

- Python
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebooks (IPython Notebooks)
- Data Science Toolkit (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sci-kit learn, etc.) 

## How to use?

You are more than welcome to use as much or as little of this code as you want. Feel free to clone it all and use it to base your own projects off of. Just be cool, don't copy and paste it straight and pass it off as your own to get an interview or something.

## Installation

You may clone this repository by entering your preferred git-enabled terminal and running:
`git clone https://github.com/tjeffkessler/DSPortfolio/`
or by using the green Clone or Download in the browser version of the main repository page. 

## Contribute

If you would like to help, thanks! You are welcome to raise issues and submit pull requests to help me improve these projects, you altruistic python samurai. I don't have a strict *bushido* here; please just be kind, constructive, and clear with any contributions.
