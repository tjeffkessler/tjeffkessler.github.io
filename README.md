# DSPortfolio: Data Science Portfolio Projects

This repository was created during my time as a Data Science student at Thinkful to host data science projects and drills that would showcase concepts and skills I learned as I progressed in the field. After some reorganization, I continue to use this repository to store one-off personal projects that don't merit their own repository (like exploratory data analysis in a Jupyter notebook).

## Languages/Tools Used

- Python
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebooks (IPython Notebooks)
- Data Science Toolkit (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sci-kit learn, etc.) 
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools (spacy, gensim)

## Projects
###[Technical Challenge](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wY3e05KF8DFec7Ww9-WEyUZx6nHu4n1i)
I included this take-home technical challenge to illustrate what I can do with a standard business question and dataset in the course of a few hours. It is an exploratory data analysis of customers based on whether or not they are members of a loyalty program.

### [ScoreAI Essay Grader](https://github.com/tjeffkessler/score_ai/blob/master/org_score/ScoreAI.ipynb)
This is the first iteration of an NLP solution to automatice essay grading. Using a corpus of essays scraped from the web, I developed a scoring metric to determine the organization (logical flow of sentences/paragraphs) and how on-topic the essay is. The score uses LDA for topic modeling and cosine similarities to ensure paragraphs stay on topic. Future iterations will collect labelled data using this model as a beta version for teachers.

### [SABER Early Childhood Education Impacts](https://github.com/tjeffkessler/DSPortfolio/blob/master/SupervisedLearning/SABEREarlyChildhoodEducationImpacts.ipynb)
Using education statistics from the World Bank, this project seeks to determine whether participation in the Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) Early Childhood Education Initiatives had any measureable impact from its start in 2010 to 2015.

### [NFL Punt Injury Analysis](https://github.com/tjeffkessler/DSPortfolio/blob/master/ExploratoryDataAnalysis/Analytic%20Report%20Final.ipynb)
This project seeks to determine patterns in punt injury plays from two seasons of NFL data and propose a soultion for preventing those injuries.
