# DSPortfolio: Data Science Portfolio Projects

This repository was created during my time as a Data Science student at Thinkful to host data science projects and drills that would showcase concepts and skills I learned as I progressed in the field. After some reorganization, I continue to use this repository to store one-off personal projects that don't merit their own repository (like exploratory data analysis in a Jupyter notebook).

## Languages/Tools Used

- Python
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebooks (IPython Notebooks)
- Data Science Toolkit (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sci-kit learn, etc.) 
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools (spacy, gensim)

## Projects
### [NLP Essay Grader](https://github.com/tjeffkessler/DSPortfolio/blob/master/UnsupervisedLearning/EssayFeedback/NLP_Organization_Scorer.ipynb)
This project is my current work-in-progress. I have begun by creating a scoring function for the organization of essays and compared its performance against hand-graded organization scores. In future iterations, I will assess the performance of all permutations of hypothesis-based scoring functions, different methods of tokenizing text, combinations of text features, and supervised and unsupervised learning models to get the best model. I will also scrape a larger corpus and run the best organized essays through a generative adverserial network (GAN) to get an expanded corpus and to submit them for hand-grading to create labels for reinforcement learning.

### [SABER Early Childhood Education Impacts](https://github.com/tjeffkessler/DSPortfolio/blob/master/SupervisedLearning/SABEREarlyChildhoodEducationImpacts.ipynb)
Using education statistics from the World Bank, this project seeks to determine whether participation in the Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) Early Childhood Education Initiatives had any measureable impact from its start in 2010 to 2015.

### [NFL Punt Injury Analysis](https://github.com/tjeffkessler/DSPortfolio/blob/master/ExploratoryDataAnalysis/Analytic%20Report%20Final.ipynb)
This project seeks to determine patterns in punt injury plays from two seasons of NFL data and propose a soultion for preventing those injuries.

### [Human Freedom Index Analysis](https://github.com/tjeffkessler/DSPortfolio/blob/master/ExploratoryDataAnalysis/HumanFreedomIndex.ipynb)
This project seeks to visualize trends in human freedom indicator scores by country or region.
