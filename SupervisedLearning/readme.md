# Supervised Learning Projects

This is the home for those projects that use supervised learning methods to solve data problems. If you are unfamiliar with supervised learning, check out its [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) until I get a better resource up here for you. 

## Tools
- **python** (coding language)
- **pandas** (data frame library)
- **numpy** (powerful linear algrebra library)
- **scikit-learn** (statistical modeling library)
- **statsmodel.api** (use R-like formulae in python)
- **seaborn** (prettier matplotlib plotting)

## Projects 
- SABER Early Childhood Education Impacts
Using education statistics from the World Bank, this project seeks to determine whether participation in the Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) Early Childhood Education Initiatives had any measureable impact from its start in 2010 to 2015.
